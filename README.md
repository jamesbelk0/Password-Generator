### Description

1. Made working confirmation windows and alerts for clicks/information

2. Set password length for user input of variables ranging from 8 to 128

3. Tweaked how the arrays would output and had a hard time making the randomizing factor work the way I intended. Math.floor(Math.random()).

4. Usable password generator that places the user inputs into a randomized password.
